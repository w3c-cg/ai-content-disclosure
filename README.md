# AI Content Disclosure Community Group

This is the repository of the [AI Content Disclosure Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/ai-content-disclosure/).

## Raising Issues

As the work of this group is likely to involve raising issues on specifications from other groups, and on user agents we can use [Issues](../../issues) in this repo to discuss AI content disclosure related issues. We can then triage them and make sure things are raised in the right place.

## Meetings

This group was formed after the AI Content Disclosure Community Group was launched on 3 February 2026.

## Contributing to the Repository

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informative—by including the issue or bug number for example.

Editorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.
